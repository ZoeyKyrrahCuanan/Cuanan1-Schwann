1. Project title
  Fractal Tree Using Python Turtle
2.What is the purpose of your project?
 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the recursive nature of fractals by creating a visually appealing tree using Pythonâ€™s Turtle graphics. 
3.How your program works? how to run your program?
  The program initializes the turtle graphics environment and defines a recursive function tree(i), which draws branches and stops when i is less than 10.
  The turtle moves forward, draws a small circle at the tip, then splits into two smaller branches by turning left and right before returning to its starting point.
  To run the program, install Python and the turtle module if needed. Save the script as fractal_tree.py and run python fractal_tree.py. 
  A Turtle window will display the fractal tree, which can be customized by modifying angles and branch lengths.
